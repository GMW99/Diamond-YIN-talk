\note{So the network limit is approximately 6GB/s, so we are able to reach this in 6 Nodes, which is very good to see, if run on a compute cluster with more per format RAM we could potentially see this number be a lot lower, as this cluster operates at approx 1GB/s per OSDs. Whats interesting to see here is that 16 threads should do the job just fine which means we can run a job at the same time creating a hyper-converged platform.}
